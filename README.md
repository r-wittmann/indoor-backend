# Getting Starded

As we just need a REST API with a little logic behind it, we decided to use NodeJS with an Express webserver.  

    $> git clone https://github.com/r-wittmann/indoor-backend.git
    $> cd indoor-backend
    $> npm install
    $> npm run develop

This starts a webserver on localhost:3000 which restarts on every code change in the project.
